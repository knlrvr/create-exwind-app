## Description
<a name='description'></a>
This template is designed to enforce type safety across your application, without compromise. It uses Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind with shadcn/ui, Convex (optional) as a complete backend solution, and Jest so you never forget to test! 

create-exwind-app is the boilerplate template of the technologies that I find myself reaching for the most. It's in no way a depiction of what I think is the best, but rather a depiction of what I have enjoyed working with. 

## Tech Choice
<a name='tech-choice'></a>
Again, these are just the technologies that I found to be the most enjoyable and productive to work with. 
#### Next.js
The industry standard for React projects. Next.js is feature-rich and ridiculously flexible. 

#### Tailwind 
Tailwind lets you speedrun CSS. It's quick, efficient, and easy to use. 

#### Convex
Convex is more than a backend. It's is a fullstack TypeScript developer platform. It's realtime, efficient, and offers a great DX. 

#### Jest
Jest is unmatched in unit testing. It's straight forward and, like this entire stack, easy to use. 

## Feedback
<a name='feedback'></a>
I usually have no idea what I'm doing! If you can improve this at all or if you have any ideas for what could be changed/added/removed/whatever, please let me know! 

I hope this is as useful to you as it is to me!
